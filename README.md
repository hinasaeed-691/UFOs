# UFOs
 Javascript

### OVERVIEW
    Dana’s webpage and dynamic table are working as intended, but she’d like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date,  other table filters for the city, state, country, and shape were required. Javascript was used to accomplish required tasks

### RESULTS
All deliverables were completed successfully. The `index.html` was successfully loaded with all filters and dynamic table. 

### SUMMARY
All this current development help to filter required data quickly but it lacks couple of key features that can be implemented in future.
    - Multiple conditions should be applied simultaneously using a apply button
    - A clear filter button should be implemented to reset the view.
